    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey all, we&rsquo;re playing a fundraiser this weekend for a charity called the Dream
Factory. The fundraiser is sponsored by a local internet radio station in honor
of D&#8217;Andre K Washington, a San Antonio boy who was granted a last wish by the
Dream Factory before he passed away.  A portion of the proceeds from the entire
day&rsquo;s profits will go to the Dream Factory, so come on out and enjoy some
delicious pizza, live music, and cold beer for a great cause!</p>
