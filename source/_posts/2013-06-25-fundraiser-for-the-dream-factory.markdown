Hey all, we're playing a fundraiser this weekend for a charity called the Dream
Factory. The fundraiser is sponsored by a local internet radio station in honor
of D'Andre K Washington, a San Antonio boy who was granted a last wish by the
Dream Factory before he passed away.  A portion of the proceeds from the entire
day's profits will go to the Dream Factory, so come on out and enjoy some
delicious pizza, live music, and cold beer for a great cause!
