Check this out everyone!  Road Home was recently featured on the Science of
Sound, a joint production of San Antonio College and Time Warner Cable.

We went into the KSYM studios at SAC and performed a baker's dozen of Road Home
songs for the cameras.  All aspects of the performance were filmed, recorded,
and produced by the SAC students in the Radio-Television-Broadcasting program.


We had a great time filming this episode and we hope you enjoy!
