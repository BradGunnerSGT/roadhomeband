Hill Country Heartbeat events is proud to sponsor the Blanco EMS fundraiser on
September 14, 2013 at Yett Park in Blanco, Texas.  Headlining the event will be 
Texas Country recording artist [Bart Crow](http://bartcrowmusic.com/).  Also
featured will be our friends [Cameran Nelson and Guardrail Damage
Ahead](http://www.camerannelson.com) and [Wes Nickson](http://www.reverbnation.com/wesnickson).  Oh, and a certain band from
San Antonio named ROAD HOME (you may have heard of us?).

Come out for an evening of great live music from ROAD HOME, Wes Nickson,
Cameran Nelson and GDA, and Bart Crow.  Proceeds from this event will go toward
a great cause: helping out the Blanco EMS raise money for much needed equipment
and facilities. This volunteer EMS unit provides lifesaving services to Blanco
and surrounding counties.
