ROAD HOME is an up and coming band based out of the San Antonio, Texas area.
We blend Country, Americana, and Rock into a very unique experience.
Introspective lyrics and catchy "stick in your mind for days" melodies are
hallmarks of the distinctive ROAD HOME sound.

{% pullquote %}
ROAD HOME derives its name from one of Kevin’s original songs, entitled "This
Road Goes Home".  This song describes someone who has left the comforts of home
and ventured out onto the Road toward his dreams.  He realizes that the Road is
a lonely and harsh place, and is tempted to just take the next exit, hang a
u-turn, and head back home.  The protagonist refuses this easy choice, and then
"{"...turned the music way up high, to forget about what I’ve left
behind..."}".  He then continues on the road to chase his dreams.   Are you on
the Road?
