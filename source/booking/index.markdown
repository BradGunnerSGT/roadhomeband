Planning an event, such as a wedding or party?  Need a band to play at your club or live music venue?  Please contact us and we will get with you to plan out your event.  We play a variety of music, from modern Top 40 Country to Rock to "Red Dirt" or "Texas" Country, and we even throw in some originals that are crowd pleasers everywhere that we play.
